Digital ID systems require persistent access to sensitive data about the entire population. # diagram: persistent_access.jpg

Even with perfect design, compromise ripples through all connected services. Your bank, your government, your employer—all compromised.

Sophisticated attackers don't smash-and-grab. They silently siphon data and monitor victims for months or years. This is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).

For a national identity system, undetected access is wildly attractive.

*   [But our systems are secure, right?]
    Not as secure as claimed.

GOV.UK One Login—the gateway to all UK government services—was breached by red-team security testers. # diagram: one_login_breach.jpg

They got in without being detected.

If friendly security experts can breach it, what can hostile nation-states do?

This wasn't an isolated incident either:
• The National Cyber Security Centre reports four nationally significant cyber attacks every week
• Over half of UK businesses reported attacks in 2024
• The JLR attack is ongoing

*   [So we should fix the security vulnerabilities.]
    You can't patch fundamental design flaws.

Modern technology is built on layers of vulnerability. # diagram: tech_stack.jpg

Zero-click flaws allow remote device control. 40% of Android devices no longer receive updates. AI-generated code is wildly insecure. Supply chains are compromised.

Age-verification systems—far simpler than national digital ID—are already being compromised. Cybercrime groups stole 2.1 million identity photos. This is happening now.

Every major company with billions in revenue and dedicated security teams has been breached: Equifax, Target, Yahoo, Facebook, LinkedIn, Adobe.

*   [Maybe we just need better security practices?]
    The problem isn't practices. It's scale.
    -> Why_Scale_Matters

=== Why_Scale_Matters ===
The Equifax breach exposed 147 million people. Target: 40 million. Yahoo: 3 billion accounts.

A national digital ID would be the most valuable target in history. Every citizen. Every identity. Every credential.

The question isn't if it will be breached. It's when—and what happens then.

*   [But even if security fails, isn't the real problem the surveillance these systems enable?]
    Exactly. Security is just the first problem.
