So if VPN bans don't work, what do we do? # diagram: parental_controls.png

We need to accept that VPN bans aren't viable and find better approaches.

The solution isn't trying to block access with technology that can be easily bypassed.

It's providing tools and approaches that work regardless of VPNs:
- On-device parental controls
- Router-level content filtering
- App-specific feature gating
- Education for parents and children
- Open communication
- Investment in offline social spaces

These approaches don't rely on identifying everyone online or blocking VPN traffic.

They work at the point of access—the device itself.

=== Better_Solutions ===
Better solutions focus on what we can control: # diagram: holistic_approach.png

<>**Device-level protections:**
- Parental controls that work regardless of which site is accessed
- Content filtering at the router or device level
- Time limits and device restrictions

<>**Education:**
- Teaching digital literacy to children and parents
- Open communication about online risks
- Critical thinking skills for evaluating content

<>**Platform accountability:**
- Requiring better safety features by default
- Age-appropriate design without surveillance
- Transparency about algorithms and content

<>**Physical alternatives:**
- Investment in youth services and community spaces
- Support for offline social connections
- Addressing root causes of problematic internet use

These solutions:
- Don't require surveillance infrastructure
- Can't be bypassed with VPNs
- Respect privacy while protecting children
- Build long-term resilience

*   [That makes more sense than bans.]
    Exactly. VPN bans sound appealing but are technically impossible and ethically problematic.
    
    Better to focus on solutions that actually work.
