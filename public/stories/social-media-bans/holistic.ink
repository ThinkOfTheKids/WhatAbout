=== Holistic_Thinking ===
The real solution requires thinking bigger than just "ban" or "allow." # diagram: holistic_approach.jpg

We need a multi-layered approach across three areas:

Physical infrastructure: Reinvest in youth services (reverse the 72% cuts), fund community centers, create safe public spaces.

Digital infrastructure: Require robust parental controls, mandate feature-gating options, hold companies accountable for harmful algorithmic design.

Education infrastructure: Digital literacy in schools, parent education programs with ongoing support, teaching critical thinking.

*   [Why do we need both physical and digital?]
    -> Need_Both_Worlds
*   [This sounds like prevention, not preparation.]
    -> Preparation_Not_Prevention

=== Need_Both_Worlds ===
Because children are growing up in both worlds.

They need to navigate offline social situations. And they need to navigate online social situations safely.

Banning one doesn't prepare them for either.

*   [How do we prepare, not just prevent?]
    -> Preparation_Not_Prevention
*   [So we need multiple approaches working together.]
    -> The_Real_Problem

=== Preparation_Not_Prevention ===
Here's the fundamental shift in thinking: # diagram: preparation_vs_prevention.jpg

Prevention: "Keep children away from all harm until they're adults."
Preparation: "Teach children to navigate challenges with increasing independence."

Prevention assumes magic age readiness. Preparation recognizes gradual learning through guidance.

*   [Give me an example.]
    -> Street_Crossing_Analogy
*   [But social media is more dangerous!]
    -> Danger_Comparison

=== Street_Crossing_Analogy ===
We don't ban children from streets until 16. We teach them to cross safely.

We hold their hand when young, teach them to look both ways, supervise with decreasing intensity. Eventually they can do it safely alone.

The same approach works for digital spaces: heavily supervised at 7-10, supervised with privacy at 10-13, decreasing supervision at 13-16, mostly independent at 16+.

*   [But social media is more dangerous than streets!]
    -> Danger_Comparison
*   [What about the addictive algorithms?]
    -> Algorithm_Control

=== Danger_Comparison ===
Both carry risks, but we've developed approaches for other hazards.

Banning until 16 then providing unlimited access doesn't build the gradual skills that come from supervised exposure over time.

*   [What about the addictive algorithms?]
    -> Algorithm_Control
*   [Preparation makes more sense than prevention.]
    -> The_Real_Problem

=== Algorithm_Control ===
That's where feature-gating comes in.

Disable "the algorithm" for young users—show only followed accounts chronologically. Limit watch time. Disable autoplay.

As they demonstrate healthy usage, gradually enable more features. This teaches moderation rather than abstinence-then-binge.

*   [So bans create more problems than they solve.]
    -> The_Real_Problem
*   [What about marginalized kids?]
    -> Marginalized_Groups
