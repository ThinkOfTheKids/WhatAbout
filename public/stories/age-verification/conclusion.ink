=== The_Real_Problem ===
Here's the uncomfortable truth: # diagram: whack_a_mole.png

We're trying to solve a social problem—how we raise and protect children—with a technical solution.

Every technical solution creates new problems. VPN bans break privacy. AI verification creates massive risks. Centralized databases become targets. App enforcement pushes people to unregulated alternatives.

=== Deeper_Issue ===
We're asking technology to replace parenting, education, and community.

We want a perfect technical lock because the social solutions are hard. They require time, attention, difficult conversations, and accepting that we can't control everything.

It's like trying to childproof the entire world instead of teaching your child how to navigate it safely.

=== The_Answer ===
Maybe the answer isn't a perfect lock on the internet.

Maybe it's better education, better parenting tools, and accepting that technology can't replace judgment.

We can provide resources: parental controls, education programs, open conversations. We can teach critical thinking, media literacy, healthy boundaries.

But we can't—and shouldn't—build a surveillance state trying to eliminate all risk. The cure would be worse than the disease.
