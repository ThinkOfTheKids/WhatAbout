Parental controls only work if parents know about them and use them. # diagram: parent_education.png

We need comprehensive parent education programs:

How to enable parental controls:
• Step-by-step guides for each device type
• What settings are recommended for different ages  
• How to adjust controls as children mature

How to coach children about online safety:
• Not taking or sharing explicit or inappropriate content
• Understanding the consequences if they do
• What to do if they encounter harmful content
• Why certain content is harmful and addictive
• The importance of regular phone checks for safety (not surveillance)

Understanding the "why":
• Why algorithms are designed to be addictive
• How to recognize manipulation and misinformation  
• Why certain features are particularly harmful to developing brains

*   [That sounds like a lot of work for parents.]
    It is. But so is dealing with the consequences of unsupervised internet access.
    
    And here's the thing: these aren't one-time conversations.
    
    As children grow and technology changes, parents need ongoing support.

Education can't be a one-time thing. # diagram: education_cycle.png

Parents need:

Regular newsletters about new apps, features, and risks their children might encounter.

Refresher courses on updated parental control features.

Community support—forums or groups where parents can ask questions and share strategies.

Age-appropriate guidance—what's normal for a 10-year-old versus a 15-year-old.

This creates an ongoing connection rather than a "set and forget" approach.

It also shifts the conversation from "the government banned it" to "our family has rules and we understand why."

*   [This seems like a lot of infrastructure.]
    It is. But compare it to:
    
    Building age verification systems for every website.
    Maintaining a massive database of identity documents.
    Enforcing bans across millions of websites and apps.  
    Dealing with VPNs, proxies, and circumvention.
    Managing the security risks of centralized ID databases.
    
    Parent education infrastructure is simpler, more effective, and doesn't create surveillance risks.
