=== The_Real_Problem ===
Here's the uncomfortable truth: # diagram: whack_a_mole.png

We're trying to solve a social problem—how we raise and protect children—with a technical solution.

Every technical solution creates new problems:
• VPN bans break legitimate privacy and security.
• AI verification creates massive privacy risks.
• Centralized databases become targets for hackers and authoritarian regimes.
• App store enforcement pushes people to unregulated alternatives.

Meanwhile, the original problem persists. Determined kids will find workarounds. They always do.

It's Whac-A-Mole with infinite moles.
Block one avenue, and three more appear.
Build a higher wall, and someone invents a taller ladder.

And here's the deeper issue: we're asking technology to replace parenting, education, and community.
We want a perfect technical lock because the social solutions are hard.
They require time, attention, difficult conversations, and accepting that we can't control everything.

The internet is a reflection of humanity—complex, messy, and impossible to childproof without breaking it for everyone.

It's like trying to childproof the entire world instead of teaching your child how to navigate it safely.

*   [So what's the answer?]
    Maybe the answer isn't a perfect lock on the internet.
    Maybe it's better education, better parenting tools, and accepting that technology can't replace judgment.
    
    We can provide resources: parental controls, education programs, open conversations between parents and children.
    We can teach critical thinking, media literacy, and healthy boundaries.
    We can create cultures where asking for help isn't stigmatized.
    
    But we can't—and shouldn't—build a surveillance state trying to eliminate all risk.
    The cure would be worse than the disease.
    
    The internet is a reflection of humanity—complex, messy, and impossible to childproof without breaking it for everyone.
    And maybe that's okay. Maybe that's how it should be.
    -> END

-> END
