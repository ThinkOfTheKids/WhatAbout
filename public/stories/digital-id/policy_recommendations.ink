Here's what responsible digital identity policy looks like: # diagram: policy_framework.png

SCRAP digital ID in all forms:
• No smartphone-based digital ID
• No Yoti-backed digital Citizen Card
• No biometric backing for any ID system
• Limit One Login strictly to accessing online government services

This doesn't mean eliminating online government services.
It means not creating surveillance infrastructure to support them.

REPEAL the Companies House identification mandate: # diagram: companies_house.png
• Remove the One Login requirement for company directors
• Use offline, in-person verification
• No biometric data storage
• Address the security concerns raised by Sir David Davis

PAUSE enforcement of the Online Safety Act's age verification requirements: # diagram: osa_pause.png
• Work with privacy, security, and technology experts
• Explore evidence-based alternatives
• Don't build infrastructure that enables mass surveillance

There are better approaches to online safety that don't require age verification.
You can explore those alternatives in the other stories.

*   [What about stricter regulation for verification providers?]
    If we're going to mandate age or ID verification despite the risks, we need proportional regulation.

*   [What other alternatives exist?]
    Many. Let me show you what actually works.
    -> Better_Approaches

=== Stricter_Regulation ===
If digital ID or age verification must exist, regulation must match the risk: # diagram: regulatory_framework.png

PROPORTIONAL FINES based on harm:
• If data could have been exposed: substantial fines
• If data was actually exposed: additional catastrophic fines
• Scale with severity and number affected

BAN improper data usage:
• No reuse of data beyond verification itself
• No consent-based data reuse privacy policies
• Consumers don't get a choice of verification vendor
• All data beyond verification status deleted within 24 hours
• Only exception: legal hold

DIGITAL WATERMARKING:
• Mark documents at point of collection
• Origin can be identified if leaked
• Enables accountability and prosecution

REGULAR AUDITS:
• All services collecting face scans or identity documents
• Unannounced inspections
• Public reporting of compliance

ANTI-MONEY-LAUNDERING GRADE REGULATIONS:
• Same standards as financial institutions
• Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework compliance
• Criminal liability for executives in case of breaches

*   [That seems reasonable if we must have these systems.]
    It's a bare minimum. But it's still treating the symptom, not the cause.
    The real solution is to avoid building these systems in the first place.
    -> Better_Approaches

=== Better_Approaches ===
Instead of surveillance infrastructure, we can: # diagram: alternative_approaches.png

MANDATE algorithmic transparency and controls:
• Clear options to disable algorithmic content
• Disable infinite scrolling
• Default-off settings for addictive features
• User control over their experience

SUPPORT responsible parenting:
• Parental training on device controls
• ISP-level content filters
• On-device restrictions, not population-wide surveillance
• Education throughout childhood about online harms

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC WORKING GROUPS:
• Identify realistic online-safety standards by sector
• Account for entity size and resources
• Similar to Ofcom's approach with One Touch Switching
• Share success and failure cases collectively

CREATE A DIGITAL BILL OF RIGHTS:
• Apply to government and private sector
• Strong protection for end-to-end encryption
• Remove warrantless access to user data
• End bulk collection of internet connection records
• Protect the right to private communication

These approaches improve safety without building surveillance infrastructure.

*   [This seems comprehensive.]
    It is. And it's based on evidence, not fear.
    But it requires accepting that we can't eliminate all risk.
