=== The_Alternative ===
VPN bans don't work. So what's the solution? # diagram: parental_controls.jpg

Instead of trying to block with technology people can bypass, use tools that work regardless:
• On-device parental controls
• Router-level content filtering
• App-specific feature restrictions
• Education for parents and children
• Open communication
• Investment in offline social spaces

These work at the point of access—the device itself. They don't depend on blocking VPNs.

=== Better_Solutions ===
Better approaches focus on what we can actually control. # diagram: holistic_approach.jpg

__Device-level protections:__
• Parental controls that work on any network
• Content filtering at router or device level
• Time limits and access restrictions

__Education:__
• Digital literacy for children and parents
• Open communication about online risks
• Critical thinking about content

__Platform accountability:__
• Better safety features by default
• Age-appropriate design without surveillance
• Transparency about algorithms

__Offline alternatives:__
• Youth services and community spaces
• Support for real-world social connections
• Addressing root causes of excessive use

These solutions:
• Don't require mass surveillance
• Can't be bypassed with VPNs
• Protect privacy while protecting children
• Build actual resilience

*   [This makes sense.]
    Exactly. VPN bans sound appealing but are technically impossible and ethically wrong.
    Better to focus on solutions that work.
