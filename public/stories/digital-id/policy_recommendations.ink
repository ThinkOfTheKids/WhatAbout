Alternatives to digital ID for identity verification: # diagram: policy_framework.jpg

In-person verification for high-stakes interactions (banking, property, employment).

Existing offline methods work for most identity checks without requiring new infrastructure.

Age verification enforcement could be paused while evidence-based alternatives are explored.

    Security regulation addresses symptoms, not root causes.

    Approaches that protect both safety and privacy.

=== Regulation_Wont_Work ===
If digital ID or age verification must exist, regulation should match the risk. But regulation doesn't solve the fundamental problem. # diagram: regulatory_framework.jpg

Even with proportional fines, banned data reuse, digital watermarking, regular audits, and criminal liability for executives—you're treating the symptom, not the cause.

The real solution is to avoid building these systems in the first place.

*   [What about the alternatives?]
    These actually work without surveillance infrastructure.

=== Better_Approaches ===
Instead of surveillance infrastructure, we can: # diagram: alternative_approaches.jpg

MANDATE algorithmic transparency. Clear options to disable algorithmic content, disable infinite scrolling, user control over experience.

SUPPORT responsible parenting. Parental training, ISP-level filters, on-device restrictions, education throughout childhood.

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC WORKING GROUPS. Identify realistic safety standards by sector, similar to Ofcom's approach.

CREATE A DIGITAL BILL OF RIGHTS. Apply to government and private sector. Strong protection for end-to-end encryption. Remove warrantless access to data.

These improve safety without building surveillance infrastructure. Based on evidence, not fear.

*   [This seems comprehensive.]
    It is. But it requires accepting that we can't eliminate all risk.
