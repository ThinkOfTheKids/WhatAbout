"What if we focused on education and tools instead of restrictions?" # diagram: parental_controls.png

Parental control software already exists:
• Filter content at the device or router level
• Parents control it, not the government
• No central database of everyone's browsing
• Works on phones, tablets, computers, and game consoles
• Can be adjusted as children mature

Education programs teaching digital literacy:
• How to evaluate sources
• Recognizing manipulation and misinformation
• Understanding manipulation tactics
• When to ask for help
• Critical thinking about online content
• Healthy digital habits and boundaries

These solutions address the actual goal: helping parents protect their children.
They don't require building surveillance infrastructure.
They don't create privacy risks for everyone.
They don't assume one-size-fits-all policies work for all families.

Different families have different values: # diagram: family_flexibility.png
Some parents want strict filtering until age 18.
Some prefer open conversation and gradual exposure.
Some focus on teaching critical thinking over blocking.

*   [But parents don't always use these tools.]
    True. But laws don't fix that.
    A parent who won't install parental controls also won't prevent their kid from using a VPN.
    A parent who isn't involved in their child's digital life won't be helped by age verification laws.
    The difference? These solutions don't create surveillance infrastructure that can be misused.
    They empower parents without endangering everyone's privacy.
