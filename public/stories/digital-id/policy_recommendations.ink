Responsible digital identity policy is actually straightforward: # diagram: policy_framework.png

SCRAP digital ID in all forms. No smartphone-based ID, no Citizen Card, no biometric backing.
REPEAL the Companies House identification mandate. Use offline, in-person verification.
PAUSE Online Safety Act age verification enforcement. Work with experts to explore evidence-based alternatives.

We can maintain online government services without building surveillance infrastructure.

*   [What if we need better security for verification systems?]
    Security regulation is a band-aid. The real solution is to not build these systems.

*   [What are the actual alternatives that work?]
    Many. Evidence-based approaches that protect both children and privacy.

=== Regulation_Wont_Work ===
If digital ID or age verification must exist, regulation should match the risk. But regulation doesn't solve the fundamental problem. # diagram: regulatory_framework.png

Even with proportional fines, banned data reuse, digital watermarking, regular audits, and criminal liability for executives—you're treating the symptom, not the cause.

The real solution is to avoid building these systems in the first place.

*   [What about the alternatives?]
    These actually work without surveillance infrastructure.

=== Better_Approaches ===
Instead of surveillance infrastructure, we can: # diagram: alternative_approaches.png

MANDATE algorithmic transparency. Clear options to disable algorithmic content, disable infinite scrolling, user control over experience.

SUPPORT responsible parenting. Parental training, ISP-level filters, on-device restrictions, education throughout childhood.

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC WORKING GROUPS. Identify realistic safety standards by sector, similar to Ofcom's approach.

CREATE A DIGITAL BILL OF RIGHTS. Apply to government and private sector. Strong protection for end-to-end encryption. Remove warrantless access to data.

These improve safety without building surveillance infrastructure. Based on evidence, not fear.

*   [This seems comprehensive.]
    It is. But it requires accepting that we can't eliminate all risk.
