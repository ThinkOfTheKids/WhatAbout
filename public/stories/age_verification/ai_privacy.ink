"AI can estimate age from your face!" # diagram: face_scanning_v2.png
The technology exists. Some systems claim 95% accuracy.

But let's think about that 5% error rate with real numbers:

If 100 million people use a site, 5 million get wrongly categorized.
That's millions of adults locked out, or millions of kids getting through.

*   [We can review the mistakes manually.]
    Can you? That's millions of appeals per site, per day.
    And appeals require... providing more ID to prove your age. Which brings us to the real concern.
    -> Privacy_Concerns

To verify your age with AI, you need to: # diagram: data_collection_v2.png
1. Upload a photo of your face.
2. Provide it to every website you visit.
3. Trust each website to store it securely.
4. Hope none of them get hacked.

Think of it like this: instead of showing your ID at the door of one bar, you have to give a photocopy of your ID to every bar in the city.

Each copy is stored in a filing cabinet that might get stolen.

*   [What about biometric data being leaked?] -> Data_Breach_Risk

=== Third_Party_Verification ===
"One company verifies everyone, then issues tokens!" # diagram: honeypot_database_v2.png

Now you have created the world's most valuable database:
- Real names
- Real faces  
- Complete list of adult websites each person visits

This is called a "honeypot" in security—a single target so valuable that every hacker on earth will attack it.

*   [But surely it can be secured?]
    Every major company has been hacked. Equifax. Target. Yahoo.
    When—not if—this database leaks, millions of people's faces and browsing habits become public.
    Perfect for blackmail, identity theft, and persecution.

=== Data_Breach_Risk ===
In 2017, Equifax leaked 147 million people's Social Security numbers, birth dates, and addresses.
In 2013, Yahoo leaked 3 billion accounts.
In 2018, Marriott leaked 500 million passport numbers.

Now imagine a leak that includes:
- Your face
- Your real name
- Every adult website you visited
- When you visited them

*   [That would be catastrophic.]
    Yes. And it's not a matter of *if*, but *when*.
    You've created a surveillance system that starts with good intentions...
    ...but becomes a tool for control and blackmail.
