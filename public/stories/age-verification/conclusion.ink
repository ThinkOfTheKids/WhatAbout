=== The_Real_Problem ===
Here's the uncomfortable truth: # diagram: whack_a_mole.jpg

We're trying to solve a social problem—how we raise and protect children—with a technical solution.

Every technical solution creates new problems. VPN bans break privacy. AI verification creates massive risks. Centralized databases become targets. App enforcement pushes people to unregulated alternatives.

=== Deeper_Issue ===
Technical solutions are being asked to solve problems that require parenting, education, and community support.

Perfect technical locks are appealing because social solutions require time, attention, and accepting that we can't control everything.

=== The_Answer ===
Maybe the answer isn't a perfect lock on the internet.

Maybe it's better education, better parenting tools, and accepting that technology can't replace judgment.

We can provide resources: parental controls, education programs, open conversations. We can teach critical thinking, media literacy, healthy boundaries.

But we can't—and shouldn't—build a surveillance state trying to eliminate all risk. The cure would be worse than the disease.
