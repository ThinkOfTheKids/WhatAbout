"If checking at the ISP level fails, what about the App Stores?" # diagram: app_ecosystem_v2.png
Apple and Google control what apps most people use.
They could enforce age verification for every app.

*   [Finally, a solution that works!]
    Not quite. Three problems:

    First: "Sideloading"—installing apps outside the store.
    Common on Android. Becoming easier on iOS due to regulations.
    A teenager can download an APK file (Android's app format) from any website.
    No app store. No verification. No restrictions.

    Second: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
    These are websites that work like apps. No app store involved.
    They can send notifications, work offline, and appear on your home screen.
    But they're just web pages. The browser loads them like any other site.

    Third: The web itself.
    Browsers don't go through app stores.
    Safari, Chrome, Firefox—they're installed by default or downloaded directly.
    Once you have a browser, you have access to the entire web.
    Any website. Any content. No app store to gatekeep.

    Even if you age-verify the browser app itself, that doesn't verify each website.
    And users can simply use older versions of browsers that don't have verification.

*   [So we're back where we started.]
    Exactly. The open web is designed to route around restrictions.
    That's not a bug—it's the fundamental architecture of the internet.
    The web was built to survive censorship, whether from authoritarian governments or network failures.
    That's a feature, not a bug.
