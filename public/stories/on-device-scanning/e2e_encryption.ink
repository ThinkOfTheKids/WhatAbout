End-to-end encryption means only you and the recipient can read your messages. # diagram: e2e_broken.png

Not the app. Not the phone company. Not the government.

But on-device scanning changes this: if your phone reads your message in plain text *before* encrypting it, the encryption is meaningless.

Yes, the message is still encrypted in transit. But it was already read by scanning software that reports back to someone.
