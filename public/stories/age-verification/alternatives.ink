"What if we focused on education and tools instead of restrictions?" # diagram: parental_controls_v3.png

Parental control software already exists:
- Filter content at the device or router level
- Parents control it, not the government
- No central database of everyone's browsing

Education programs teaching digital literacy:
- How to evaluate sources
- Understanding manipulation
- When to ask for help

*   [But parents don't always use these tools.]
    True. But laws don't fix that.
    A parent who won't install parental controls also won't prevent their kid from using a VPN.
    The difference? These solutions don't create surveillance infrastructure that can be misused.
