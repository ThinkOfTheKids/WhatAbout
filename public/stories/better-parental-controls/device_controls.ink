=== Device_Controls ===
On-device parental controls already exist on phones, tablets, and computers. # diagram: parental_controls.png

Most people don't realize how powerful these tools are.

Parents can set them up to:
• Require approval before installing new apps
• Filter web content with the ability to override specific sites
• Set time limits for the device or specific apps
• Lock the device during school hours or at night
• Block or limit purchases
• Receive reports on device usage

These controls work at the device level. No central database. No government surveillance. No privacy risks for millions of people.

And here's the crucial difference from age verification or bans: VPNs don't bypass them.

The controls are on the device itself. It doesn't matter which website the child tries to access or which country it appears to come from.

    That's actually a feature, not a bug.
    
    Different families have different needs and values. # diagram: family_diversity.png
    
    Some parents want strict filtering until age 18.
    Some prefer gradual exposure with conversation and guidance.
    Some focus on teaching critical thinking rather than blocking.
    
    Parental controls let families make these decisions themselves rather than having the government decide for everyone.
    
    And there's an even better approach for specific platforms.

    That's where education comes in.
