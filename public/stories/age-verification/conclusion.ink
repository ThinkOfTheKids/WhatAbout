=== The_Real_Problem ===
Here's the uncomfortable truth: # diagram: whack_a_mole_v2.png

We're trying to solve a social problem—how we raise and protect children—with a technical solution.

Every technical solution creates new problems:
- VPN bans break legitimate privacy and security.
- AI verification creates massive privacy risks.
- Centralized databases become targets for hackers and authoritarian regimes.
- App store enforcement pushes people to unregulated alternatives.

Meanwhile, the original problem persists. Determined kids will find workarounds. They always do.

*   [So what's the answer?]
    Maybe the answer isn't a perfect lock on the internet.
    Maybe it's better education, better parenting tools, and accepting that technology can't replace judgment.
    The internet is a reflection of humanity—complex, messy, and impossible to childproof without breaking it for everyone.
