Lets talk about...
I think we should age verify online content. # diagram: happy_Internet_v2.png

On the surface, it seems like a no-brainer.
We want to protect children from harmful content. 
If we require ID or age verification, we can ensure only adults see adult content.

*   [That sounds reasonable.]
    It does. Ideally, it works perfectly.
    But there is a major loophole that undermines the entire system.
    -> The_Loophole

=== The_Loophole ===
People can use VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to bypass these checks. # diagram: vpn_bypass_v2.png
By routing their traffic through a different country that doesn't have these laws, they can access whatever they want.
This pushes people towards free, often unsafe, VPN services just to access the web.

*   [So we should ban VPNs!] -> Ban_VPNs
*   [We should use AI to verify age.] -> AI_Verification
*   [Can't we just force age verification on the apps?] -> Force_Apps
*   [What about other solutions?] -> Alternative_Solutions
