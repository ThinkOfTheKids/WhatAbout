Protecting children is important. But on-device scanning is being presented as the *only* choice. # diagram: false_choice.png

That's false.

**Option A:** Scan everyone's private messages all the time, break encryption, create surveillance infrastructure, hope it's never misused.

**Option B:** Use targeted law enforcement, voluntary parental controls, education, and support services without sacrificing everyone's privacy.

We don't have to choose between privacy and safety.

Better ways exist to protect children: # diagram: better_alternatives.png

**For parents:**
• Voluntary parental controls that parents configure
• Education about online safety
• Open communication about online risks

**For law enforcement:**
• Traditional warrants for targeted surveillance
• International cooperation taking down abuse networks
• Resources for investigating and prosecuting offenders

**For platforms:**
• Better reporting tools
• Human moderators (not just AI)
• Cooperation on specific investigations

None require scanning everyone's messages all the time.

The most important thing is to stay informed and engaged.

These policies affect everyone who uses digital communication—which is essentially everyone.

Don't let surveillance infrastructure be built in the name of safety without asking if there's a better way.

Thanks for learning about this.
