=== Holistic_Thinking ===
The real solution requires thinking bigger than just "ban" or "allow." # diagram: holistic_approach.png

We need a multi-layered approach:

Physical infrastructure:
• Reinvest in youth services (reverse the 72% cuts)
• Fund youth clubs and community centers  
• Create and maintain safe public spaces
• Support organized activities and sports
• Provide affordable transportation for teenagers

Digital infrastructure:
• Require platforms to offer robust parental controls
• Mandate feature-gating options for parents
• Hold companies accountable for harmful algorithmic design
• Enforce existing laws against predatory behavior

Education infrastructure:
• Digital literacy in schools from an early age
• Parent education programs with ongoing support  
• Teaching critical thinking about online content
• Age-appropriate discussions about online safety
• Community resources for families

This addresses the root causes rather than just treating symptoms.

*   [Why do we need both physical and digital?]
    Because children are growing up in both worlds.
    
    They need to learn to navigate offline social situations.
    And they need to learn to navigate online social situations safely.
    
    Banning one doesn't prepare them for either.
    
    -> Preparation_Not_Prevention

=== Preparation_Not_Prevention ===
Here's the fundamental shift in thinking: # diagram: preparation_vs_prevention.png

Prevention says: "Keep children away from all harm until they're adults."

Preparation says: "Teach children to navigate challenges with increasing independence."

Prevention assumes that at some magic age (16? 18? 21?) people are suddenly ready.

Preparation recognizes that people learn gradually through guidance and experience.

Think about how we teach children to cross the street:
• We don't ban them from streets until they're 16
• We hold their hand when they're young
• We teach them to look both ways  
• We supervise with decreasing intensity
• Eventually they can do it safely on their own

The same approach works for digital spaces:

Age 7-10: Heavily supervised, limited access, lots of conversation
Age 10-13: Supervised with some privacy, filtered content, ongoing check-ins
Age 13-16: Decreasing supervision, more autonomy, trust with verification  
Age 16+: Mostly independent with open communication

*   [But social media is more dangerous than crossing streets!]
    Is it? Or is it just less familiar to parents?
    
    Cars kill tens of thousands of people every year. But we've learned to teach children road safety.
    
    Social media has risks. Real ones. But banning it until 16 and then giving unlimited access doesn't prepare anyone.
    
    It just delays exposure while preventing the gradual learning process that builds resilience.

*   [What about the addictive algorithms?]
    That's where feature-gating comes in.
    
    Disable "the algorithm" for young users. Show only posts from followed accounts, chronologically.
    
    Limit watch time. Disable autoplay.
    
    As they demonstrate healthy usage, gradually enable more features.
    
    This teaches moderation rather than abstinence-then-binge.

*   [I see the problems with bans now.] -> The_Real_Problem

=== Better_Approach ===
Instead of blanket bans, we could: # diagram: better_approach.png

Empower parents with tools and education—not surveillance.

Require platforms to offer meaningful controls—not just age gates.

Invest in physical social infrastructure—not just cut spending.

Teach digital literacy from childhood—not just block and hope.

Support families with ongoing resources—not one-time laws.

This approach:
• Respects family autonomy and values  
• Protects privacy for everyone
• Adapts to individual needs
• Builds long-term skills
• Doesn't create surveillance infrastructure
