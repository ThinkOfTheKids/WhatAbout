=== Approved_VPNs ===
"We'll only allow approved government and corporate VPNs!" # diagram: two_tier_internet.png

This creates a two-tier internet. The wealthy get secure connections. Regular people get surveillance.

Think about "approved" in practice:
• Government sees where the VPN connects
• They demand logs of who uses it and when
• They can revoke approval instantly
• VPN providers must cooperate with authorities

A security tool becomes a surveillance tool.

It's like saying: "Curtains are illegal unless you apply for a government license and let them peek through."

Who gets approval? Corporations, maybe large hospitals. But freelance journalists? Political activists? Ordinary privacy-conscious people? No.

And the problem still exists. Kids use their parent's work VPN. Their older sibling's university account. Their friend's family business VPN.

You've built massive surveillance infrastructure without solving anything.
