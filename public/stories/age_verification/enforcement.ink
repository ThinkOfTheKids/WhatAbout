Apple and Google control what apps most people use.

    Not quite. Three problems:

First: "Sideloading"—installing apps outside the store.
Common on Android. Becoming easier on iOS due to regulations.

Second: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
These are websites that work like apps. No app store involved.

Third: The web itself.
Browsers don't go through app stores.

    That's a feature, not a bug.
