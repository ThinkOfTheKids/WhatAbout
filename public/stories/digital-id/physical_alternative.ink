=== Physical_vs_Digital ===
Many actions requiring proof of identity occur only once or twice a year. # diagram: infrequent_checks.png

Opening a bank account. Renting a property. Applying for a passport.
These are occasional events, not daily occurrences.

Digital ID may offer convenience, but at what cost?

I would much rather briefly present my passport to a human being than assume the risks these systems create. # diagram: human_verification.png

When you show physical ID to a person:
• They see it once
• They don't record it
• They can't track you later
• They can't sell your data
• The interaction ends when you leave

When you use digital ID:
• It's logged permanently
• Every verification is tracked
• Your pattern of behavior is recorded
• Data can be aggregated across services
• The surveillance never ends

Digital verification is not equivalent to in-person checks. # diagram: false_equivalence.png

The consequences of compromise are severe and irreversible.
A stolen credit card can be cancelled.
A leaked password can be changed.
But your face is permanent. Your biometric data is permanent. Your identity is permanent.

*   [So we should avoid all digital ID?]
    For anything beyond accessing government services, yes.
    And even then, without biometric backing.
    Let me show you what the alternatives look like.
