=== Approved_VPNs ===
"We'll only allow corporate or government-approved VPNs!" # diagram: two_tier_internet.png

This creates a two-tier internet:
Businesses and the wealthy get secure, private connections.
Regular citizens are forced to expose their browsing to government surveillance.

Think about what "approved" means in practice:
• The government can see where the VPN connects
• They can demand logs of who uses it and when
• They can revoke approval at any time
• They create a list of "trusted" VPNs that must cooperate with authorities

This transforms a security tool into a surveillance tool.

It's like saying: "Curtains are now illegal unless you're rich enough to apply for a curtain license."
And oh, by the way, the government gets to peek through approved curtains whenever they want.

Who gets approval? 
• Corporations, certainly
• Government contractors
• Maybe large hospitals and universities

But:
• Freelance journalists? Probably not.
• Political activists? Unlikely.
• Ordinary citizens who value privacy? No chance.

*   [That doesn't seem fair.]
    It's not. And it creates new problems:
    
    Children and teenagers can still use their parent's work laptop with an "approved" VPN.
    
    Or their older sibling's university VPN.
    
    Or a friend whose parents work for a company with VPN access.
    
    You've created a surveillance infrastructure without solving the underlying problem.
