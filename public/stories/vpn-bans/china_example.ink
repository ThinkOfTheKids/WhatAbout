China's Great Firewall is often cited as proof that VPN blocking works. # diagram: great_firewall.jpg

Here's what happens in practice:

China blocks known VPN IP addresses. VPN companies create new servers with new IPs. This cycle continues.

China employs significant resources for deep packet inspection and traffic pattern analysis.

Yet VPNs still work in China. Users create personal VPN servers on cloud platforms that appear as normal web traffic. Businesses maintain international connections.

Blocking all encrypted traffic to foreign servers would disrupt international trade and business operations.

=== Technical_Reality ===
You cannot eliminate VPNs without breaking the internet itself. # diagram: vpn_bypass.jpg

Any VPN ban will:
• Harm legitimate users (workers, journalists, activists)
• Require massive surveillance infrastructure
• Fail to stop determined users
• Drive people to less secure services

Policies that require blocking VPNs are fundamentally unworkable.
