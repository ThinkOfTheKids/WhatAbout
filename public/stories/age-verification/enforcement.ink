"If checking at the ISP level fails, what about the App Stores?" # diagram: app_ecosystem.png
Apple and Google control what apps most people use.
They could enforce age verification for every app.

*   [Finally, a solution that works!]
    Not quite. Three problems:

    First: "Sideloading"—installing apps outside the store.
    Common on Android. Becoming easier on iOS due to regulations.
    A teenager can download an APK file (Android's app format) from any website.
    No app store. No verification. No restrictions.

    Second: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
    These are websites that work like apps. No app store involved.
    They can send notifications, work offline, and appear on your home screen.
    But they're just web pages. The browser loads them like any other site.

    Third: The web itself. # diagram: app_bypass.png
    Browsers don't go through app stores.
    Safari, Chrome, Firefox—they're installed by default or downloaded directly.
    Once you have a browser, you have access to the entire web.
    Any website. Any content. No app store to gatekeep.

    Even if you age-verify the browser app itself, that doesn't verify each website.
    And users can simply use older versions of browsers that don't have verification.

*   [So we're back where we started.]
    Exactly. The open web is designed to route around restrictions.
    That's not a bug—it's the fundamental architecture of the internet.
    The web was built to survive censorship, whether from authoritarian governments or network failures.
    That's a feature, not a bug.

=== Real_World_Impact ===
And we're already seeing this play out in practice. # diagram: user_migration.png

Early data from age-verification enforcement shows:
• Compliant sites hemorrhaged users
• Non-compliant sites experienced massive growth
• One adult site estimated it had 3,000 clones
• Only 37% of users say they're likely to complete age-verification

Users always seek the path of least friction.
When you force intrusive checks on compliant sites, traffic naturally flows to non-compliant alternatives.
These unregulated sites then climb search rankings as user numbers grow.

This applies to gaming too. # diagram: gaming_impact.png
Ninety-five percent of studios develop at least one live-service title, with multiplayer communication core to the experience.
Yet platforms like Xbox are mandating age-verification for online communication.
Studios and platform holders are blocking communication for non-verified users rather than risk fines.
Those who refuse to—or cannot—age-verify are left with a much smaller online world.

*   [This seems counterproductive.]
    It is. We're pushing people toward less safe alternatives.
    And we're fragmenting online communities in the process.
