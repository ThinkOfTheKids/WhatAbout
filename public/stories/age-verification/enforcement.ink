"If checking at the ISP level fails, what about App Stores?" # diagram: app_ecosystem.jpg

Apple and Google control what apps most people use. They could enforce age verification for every app.

    -> App_Store_Problems

=== App_Store_Problems ===
Three problems:

First: "Sideloading"—installing apps outside the store. Common on Android, becoming easier on iOS. A teenager can download an APK file from any website. No app store, no verification.

Second: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). These are websites that work like apps. No app store involved.

Third: The web itself.

=== The_Web_Bypass ===
Browsers don't go through app stores. # diagram: app_bypass.jpg

Safari, Chrome, Firefox—installed by default or downloaded directly. Once you have a browser, you have access to the entire web. Any website, any content.

Even if you age-verify the browser app itself, that doesn't verify each website. And users can simply use older versions of browsers without verification.

    -> Real_World_Impact

=== Where_We_Started ===
Exactly. The open web is designed to route around restrictions.

That's not a bug—it's the fundamental architecture of the internet. The web was built to survive censorship, whether from authoritarian governments or network failures.

    -> The_Real_Problem

=== Real_World_Impact ===
We're already seeing this play out:[5] # diagram: user_migration.jpg
• Compliant sites hemorrhaged users
• Non-compliant sites experienced massive growth
• One adult site estimated it had 3,000 clones
• Only 37% of users say they're likely to complete age-verification[4]

Users seek the path of least friction. Intrusive checks on compliant sites? Traffic flows to non-compliant alternatives.[3]

=== Gaming_Impact ===
This applies to gaming too.[6] # diagram: gaming_impact.jpg

95% of studios develop at least one live-service title, with multiplayer communication core to the experience.[7] Platforms like Xbox now mandate age-verification for online communication.[8]

Roblox's AI age verification launched in 2026 to immediate chaos:[9] verified accounts for 9-year-olds sold on eBay for $4, kids with marker-drawn stubble rated 21+, and chat usage dropped from 85% to 36%.

Studios block communication for non-verified users rather than risk fines. Those who cannot age-verify are left with a much smaller online world.

*   [This seems counterproductive.]
    -> Counterproductive_Reality
*   [What's the alternative?]
    -> The_Real_Problem

=== Counterproductive_Reality ===
It is. We're pushing people toward less safe alternatives. And we're fragmenting online communities in the process.
