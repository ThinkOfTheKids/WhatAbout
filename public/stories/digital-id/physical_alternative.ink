=== Physical_vs_Digital ===
Many identity checks happen once or twice a year. # diagram: infrequent_checks.png

Opening a bank account. Renting a property. Applying for a passport. These are occasional events, not daily occurrences.

Digital ID offers convenience, but at what cost?

I'd much rather briefly show my passport to a human being than assume the risks these systems create.

*   [What's the difference between physical and digital verification?]
    Everything.

=== Why_Physical_Is_Better ===
When you show physical ID to a person: # diagram: human_verification.png

They see it once. They don't record it. They can't track you later. They can't sell your data. The interaction ends when you leave.

When you use digital ID:
• It's logged permanently
• Every verification is tracked
• Your pattern of behavior is recorded
• Data aggregated across services
• Surveillance never ends

*   [But what about if my digital ID gets stolen?]
    That's the real problem.
    -> Why_Biometrics_Matter

=== Why_Biometrics_Matter ===
A stolen credit card can be cancelled. A leaked password can be changed.

But your face is permanent. Your biometric data is permanent. Your identity is permanent.

Once leaked, you can't un-leak it. Every camera becomes a potential identifier. Every facial database becomes a threat.

*   [So what's the solution?]
    There are better ways that don't require building a surveillance state.
