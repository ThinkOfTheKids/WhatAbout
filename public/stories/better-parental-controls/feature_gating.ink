=== Feature_Gating ===
Here's an idea that tech companies could implement: app-specific parental controls. # diagram: feature_gating.png

Instead of blocking entire platforms, let parents control which features children can access.

For WhatsApp:
• Limit messaging to approved contacts only
• Get copied on group chats
• Require approval to join new groups

For Instagram/TikTok:
• Disable "the algorithm" (only show posts from followed accounts in chronological order)
• Limit who can message or comment
• Set viewing time limits
• Require approval for new follows

For YouTube:
• Restrict to approved channels only
• Disable autoplay and recommendations  
• Enable restricted mode by default

This is more acceptable to tech firms than outright bans or age verification. It's also more effective.

The child can still access the platform and stay connected with friends. But the most harmful features—the addictive algorithms, unrestricted stranger contact, endless scrolling—are controlled by parents.

As the child demonstrates maturity, parents can gradually enable more features. This teaches moderation rather than abstinence-then-binge.

*   [Why don't we have this already?]
    Some platforms have started implementing versions of this.
    
    But there's no regulation requiring it, and companies prioritize engagement over safety.
    
    Requiring robust parental feature controls would be more effective than age bans—and wouldn't require surveillance infrastructure.
    
    But even with perfect tools, they only work if parents know about and use them.

*   [This makes sense. What else?]
    Education is the other crucial piece.
    -> Parent_Education
