China's Great Firewall is often cited as proof that VPN blocking works. # diagram: great_firewall.jpg

Here's what actually happens:

China plays Whac-A-Mole with VPN servers. They block known IPs. VPN companies create new servers. The cycle repeats.

China employs thousands of engineers. They use deep packet inspection, analyzing traffic patterns. They block suspicious protocols. They've spent two decades and billions of dollars on the most sophisticated censorship system in history.

And yet—VPNs still work in China.

Technically savvy users create personal VPN servers on cloud platforms (indistinguishable from normal web traffic). Students connect to home country servers. Businesses maintain international connections.

The government would have to block all encrypted traffic to all foreign servers—which would destroy international trade and economic ties.

China's economy depends on foreign investment, manufacturing, and exports. Cutting encrypted connections would be economic suicide.

Even the world's most authoritarian surveillance state—with unlimited resources and control—cannot eliminate VPNs without breaking the internet.

The UK has none of China's resources or control. If China can't do it, no democracy can.

You cannot eliminate VPNs without breaking the internet itself. # diagram: vpn_bypass.jpg

Any VPN ban will:
• Harm legitimate users (workers, journalists, activists)
• Require massive surveillance infrastructure
• Fail to stop determined users
• Drive people to less secure services

Policies that require blocking VPNs are fundamentally unworkable.
